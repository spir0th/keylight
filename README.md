# KeyLight
A simple shell script that turns on/off the keyboard's backlight.

## Install
Simply put the script into your desired destination (e.g `/usr/bin`, `/bin`)

*This project requires `xset` command to be installed. To use an alternative program, modify the script instead.*

## Usage
```shell
Usage: keylight [OPTIONS...]

Options:
  --help: Print help information then exit
  --verbose: Print detailed information for advanced users
```

## License
This project doesn't have any license yet. I'm still thinking which license to use for. :P
